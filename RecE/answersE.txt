7. The sizes of getsizechild.c and getsizesthread.c were reported correctly. The total size was reported incorrectly because it didn't take into account the size of getsizeschild.c. 
8. The total size would still be wrong, still showing the size of getsizesthread.c alone.
9. All values were reported correctly.
10. Without the join, the parent thread does not wait for the created and the size of getsizeschild.c is not accounted for.
11. Answers reverted to normal after uncommenting.
12. getsizesthread.c cannot compile without the reference, that joins the required library for pthread functions.
13. getsizeschild works as normal. getsizesthread does not exist as it could not compile.
14. Putting the linkage instruction back in makes it work again.
